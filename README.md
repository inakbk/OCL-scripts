# OCL-scripts

Scripts by Jørgen E. Midtbø for stuff, such as data analysis, at the Oslo Cyclotron Lab.

## The OCL calibration library
This is an extensive library of Python functions for aligning and calibrating spectra from SiRi and CACTUS. It should also be perfectly possible to apply them to other types of spectra, potentially with minor tweaks. 

There are example scripts showing how to use them, with corresponding spectrum files.




TODO: Add explanation of how to make gain-shift files, including example files.


## The peakfinder script
This is a script by Alexander Bürger that is very nice for determining the locations of peaks in 2D SiRi spectra. I have modified it slightly such that pressing "u" moves you to the next spectrum in line, while pressing "space" gives you another shot at the same spectrum.
