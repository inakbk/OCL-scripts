## The OCL calibration library
This is an extensive library of Python functions for aligning and calibrating spectra from SiRi and CACTUS. It should also be perfectly possible to apply them to other types of spectra, potentially with minor tweaks. 

There are example scripts showing how to use them, with corresponding spectrum files.




TODO: Add explanation of how to make gain-shift files, including example files.
